# Roulette

This project uses discrete probability theory to examine the game of roulette. The powerpoint slideshow in this repository contains derivations of the expected return from playing roulette with independent bets and by implementing the Martingale system.

The Python code simulates roulette and outputs a graph of player balance vs. number of spins for various betting schemes. Keeping the law of large numbers in mind, these simulations confirm the expected value calculations by showing that average earnings over many trials converges to calculated expected earnings.
